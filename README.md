My Data Science capstone project

This file will describe each file that will be uploaded.

Data Cleaning and Exploration.ipynb is where the data is cleaned, explored, and the visualizations are created. 

Running Classification Models.ipynb is where the 4 classification models are ran. 

Player Data with Blast.csv is the data before it's cleaned. 

b1.csv, b2.csv, b3.csv, b4.csv are the csv files with some of the data cleaned, but without the mean imputation.

b1Mean.csv, b2Mean.csv, b3Mean.csv, b4Mean.csv are the csv files with the cleaned data and mean imputation.

Capstone Project.pdf is a pdf of the poster.
